# Cognitive Services Demo

This blazor application shows how to use the following Cognitive Services APIs:

- Vision
- Speech
- Language understanding

This sample uses Azure App Configuration to pull the values for the keys and endpoints used, if you do not want to use that service you can remove the following lines from the Program.cs file in the ReportProcessing project. You will have to hardcode the values or pull them from the appsettings file.
